# ACCOUNTS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The format i am going with this the accounts and roles is a sort of incremental model
with donor as the lowest level and admin as the highest level.
so we have the following roles:
1. Donor
2. Volunteer
3. Volunteer Coordinator
3. Staff
4. Admin


# RELATIONSHIPS
All relationships that refer to the user are made to the userprofile table. This is because there is a 1-1 relationship
with the user table and this frees up load on the user table, thus the user table is solely for authentication
